Elementary AVC/H.264 stream does not contain timing information (excluding
rare cases when presentation times are signaled in picture-timing SEI messages).

Therefore, in order to encapsulate elementary stream into mp4 container or
mpeg-system program or transport stream it's required to compute DTS/PTS
such that the following conditions are met:

1) DTS <= PTS

2) differences between PTS magnitudes of successive frames (in play order)
is constant and equal to 1/fps (whre fps is frame rate). In other words
PTS of current frame differ from PTS of the previous frame (in presentation
order) equal to the frame duration (i.e. 1/fps).

3) If HRD is used then PTS-DTS gap should be small in order not to violate DPB buffer.

Let's for simplicity assume that both DTS and PTS are in frame duration units
(in case of interlace video - in field duration units).

Case 1:  [B frames are not used]

DTS = PTS and DTS equal to frame counter

Case 2:  [B frames are used but not used as reference (i.e. no B-pyramid)]

Let's assume that GOP structure is fixed in the sense that the interval M
betweeen two I/P frames in encoding order is constant. For example:
M for IPBBPBB... cadence is 2, M for IPBPBIB... cadence is 1.

Calculation of DTS/PTS can be outlined as follows:

For the very first frame  DTS = 0 and PTS = 1 (one frame period delay)

For other frames Do

    If frame is B then PTS = DTS (since B frame is not used for reference
    and there is no sense to delay it in DPB)

    If frame is P or I  then  PTS = DTS + M + 1

EndFor

If M is not constant we can take M equal to the maximal interval between I/P frames
(in encoding order). For example, for BluRay streams we know a-priory that M does not exceed 3
(BluRay spec. does not allow more than 3 consecutive B frames present). However, if we use M
as the maximal interval between I/P frames then we guarnatee DTS<=PTS, however differences
between PTS of successive frames (in play order) might be not equal to the frame duration
and consequently the playback is jittered.

The following example illustrates PTS jitter:

Encoding order:

I0  P1  B2   B3   P4   B5   B6   B7   P8   B9

Play order

I0  B2  B3   P1   B5   B6   B7   P4   B9   P8

PTS
1   2   3   5(4)  5    6    7    8    9   12(10)

Take M = 3 (max B before P)

Frame       DTS       PTS

I0          0           1

P1          1           5 // 1 + 3 + 1 ==> 1 + 2 + 1

B2          2           2

B3          3           3

P4          4           8 // 4 + 3 + 1

B5          5           5

B6          6           6

B7          7           7

P8          8           12 // 8 + 3 + 1 ==> 8 + 1 + 1

B9          9           9

So, PTS playback is not smooth because difference in PTS between two successive frames
(in play order) e.g. B3 and P1 is 2 frame periods and not 1.

To resolve this PTS gap issue, for each I/P frame we have to look-ahead and to
determine how many B frames following the current I/P frame. 

If we come back to the above example, for P1 the interval M=2 and hence PTS
of P1 equal to 4 instead of 5.
